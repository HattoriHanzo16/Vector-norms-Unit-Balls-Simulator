# Vector-norms/Unit-Balls-Simulator
Simulating Unit balls  and RBG norm distance calculations with fancy physics (implemented from scratch).

## Installation

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install numpy and turtle modules alongside with tkinter

```bash
pip install tk
pip install turtle
pip install numpy
```

## Usage
Run the balls.py file

```bash
python balls.py
```

If you press P, randomly selected ball will get bigger in size.

And other balls will have numbers labeled on them,representing how "close" are they
to selected ball's RGB value.(calculations are done with vector norm differences)
